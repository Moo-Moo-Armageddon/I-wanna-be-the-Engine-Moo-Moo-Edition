# I wanna be the Engine: Moo Moo Edition

Modified version of Lemon engine to fix some bugs and add cool new features

My goal for this engine is to make the best GM8.1 engine (that doesn't use extensions).

Hopefully, I succeeded :)


Features:
- New sample rooms
- Backported YoYoYo engine objects
- New trigger objects (Multi-triggers, Stoppers, etc)

and a bit more!
